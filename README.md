# MinSort-Algorithm-for-Bipartite-Graph-Optimization
This project applies the MinSort algorithm to minimize cuts and crossings in a bipartite graph. 
It involves forming the graph using a linked list data structure, calculating cuts and crossings, and implementing the MinSort algorithm for label and position optimization.
Results include the quantification of cuts and crossings before and after applying the algorithm, showcasing the effectiveness of MinSort in graph optimization.
